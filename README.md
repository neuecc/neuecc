I'm Yoshifumi Kawai, CEO/CTO of Cysharp, Inc.

I have published a lot of C# OSS.  
Currently, I continue to publish OSS at [github.com/Cysharp](https://github.com/Cysharp), so please look there for the latest production OSS.  
I strive to provide state-of-the-art libraries that are always mindful of performance and modern APIs.  
As the original author of MessagePack for C#, I also continue to maintain it in the [MessagePack-CSharp](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp) Organization.

If you want to support me, please see [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/neuecc)

This is currently my primary focus for C# OSS.
